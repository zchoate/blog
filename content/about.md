## A bit about me

My name is Zach Choate. In my freetime, I have been putting together this blog to document some of the things I've been doing and act as yet another resource that pops up in your search of *"How do I deploy xyz with abc tool?"*. Most of what you'll see here is geared towards Azure, but you'll see some other cloud content pop up here. I try to be cloud agnostic when coming up with solutions, so I'll lean towards leveraging containerization platforms like Kubernetes so the deployments are closer to consistent between the clouds - hence the *with a Chance of Containers*. I try to leverage Open Source Software where possible. I'm a firm believer of more eyes on the code = less bugs. OSS projects like Linux can enable someone to leverage a sub-100 USD computer to easily access the internet and read blogs like this one to skillup and find a career in IT.
